# QuantumCodebook

This repository is just a remote copy for my solutions to
[Xanadu's Quantum Codebook](https://codebook.xanadu.ai/). I make no promises
about the correctness of any of my code, and this is more to document my
progress in learning about the world of quantum programming.
Suggestions/comments welcome in the issues tab! :sunglasses:

**Note:** The solution Python files are not meant to be run standalone; they
must be copy-pasted into the Quantum Codebook.
